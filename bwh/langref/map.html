<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">The &lt;<span class="keyword">map</span>&gt; element describes the
relationships among a set of resources, such as DITA topics. Maps
consist of references to topics, maps, and other resources organized
into hierarchies, groups, and tables. Maps express these relationships
in a single common format that can be used for different outputs. </p>

<div class="section"><p class="p">The containing element for a map is the &lt;<span class="keyword">map</span>&gt;
element. Within the map, use the &lt;<span class="keyword">topicref</span>&gt;
element to add and organize references to the topics, and the &lt;topicgroup&gt;
and &lt;reltable&gt; elements to provide non-hierarchical relationships.
You can use the &lt;map&gt; element to set default attribute values
for all &lt;topicref&gt; elements in the map.</p>
<div class="p">A map describes
the relationships among a set of DITA topics. The following are some
examples of relationships that can be described in a map:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">Hierarchical (Parent/Child). Nested topics create a hierarchical
relationship. The topic that does the nesting is the parent, and the
topics that are nested are the children.</li>

<li class="li">Ordered. Child topics can be labeled as having an ordered relationship,
which means they are referenced in a definite sequence.</li>

<li class="li">Family. Child topics can be labeled as having a family relationship,
which means they all refer to each other.</li>

</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">When rendering a map, processors may make use of these
relationships, such as to create a Table of Contents (TOC), aggregate
topics into a PDF document, or create links between topics in output.</p>
<p class="p">The title element
may optionally be used to provide a title for the map (the title element
is preferred over the title attribute). In some scenarios the title
is purely informational, and is present as an aid to the author. In
other scenarios it may be useful or even required. For example, if
a map is converted to Eclipse Help, the Eclipse system will require
a title for the resulting table of contents. In the bookmap specialization
of map, the &lt;title&gt; element provides a title for the book represented
by that map.</p>
