While the &lt;data&gt; element can be used directly to capture properties, it is particularly useful as a basis for specialization. Default processing should treat the content as an unknown kind of metadata and ignore it for rendering, but custom processing may match the name attribute or specialized element and use the element for automated manipulation or to format data associated with the body flow. For example, a specialized data element may be used to format properties as sidebars or other adornments or to harvest properties for automated processing.">data</a> or <a class="- topic/xref  ajaxLink" href="data-about.html" title="The &lt;data-about&gt; element identifies the subject of a property when the subject isn't associated with the context in which the property is specified.

There are also optional attributes that indicate the size to which the included graphic or artwork should be scaled. An image element must specify an href attribute, a keyref attribute, or both. When both keyref and href are specified, the href is used as a fallback when the key reference cannot be resolved. The image addressed by the keyref or href is brought into the main flow of the content as rendered.
