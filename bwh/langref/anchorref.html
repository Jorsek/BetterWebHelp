<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc"><span class="ph">The &lt;<span class="keyword">anchorref</span>&gt; element
is used to reference an &lt;anchor&gt; element in a map.</span> The contents
of an &lt;anchorref&gt; element are rendered both in the original authored
location and at the location of the referenced &lt;anchor&gt; element.
The referenced &lt;<span class="keyword">anchor</span>&gt; element may be defined
in the current map or another map. <span class="ph">When possible,
this integration is done when displaying the map with &lt;anchor&gt;
to an end user. </span></p>

<div class="section"><p class="p">This function of the &lt;anchorref&gt; element is similar
to that provided by the anchorref attribute of the &lt;map&gt; element.
However, instead of attaching an entire map to an anchor point, this
element allows the author to attach only the contents of a single
map branch. This enables architects to reuse a branch of content without
reusing the entire map.</p>
<p class="p">If the rendering platform does not support
runtime integration of navigation based on the anchor point, a build
system should treat the &lt;anchorref&gt; element similar to a "conref
push" instruction by pushing the content to the spot that contains
the anchor. Note that many &lt;anchorref&gt; elements may push content
to the same point; the order in which items are pushed is left undefined,
although the order within a single &lt;anchorref&gt; is preserved.</p>
<p class="p">Metadata
cascading must take place in the original authored context, because
the branch of content defined with the &lt;anchorref&gt; remains independent
from the referenced map. The &lt;anchorref&gt; content does not take
on the cascading metadata at the &lt;anchor&gt; location. For example,
if the map containing the &lt;anchorref&gt; element sets a local copyright,
that copyright cascades to the &lt;anchorref&gt; element and its children;
it is retained after the content is rendered at the target &lt;anchor&gt;
element.</p>
<p class="p">By default, the content of the &lt;anchorref&gt; element
is rendered at both the anchor target and the original location. To
prevent the content from being rendered at the location of the &lt;anchorref&gt;
element, set toc="no" on the &lt;anchorref&gt; element, and then set
toc="yes" on each of its children so that they will not inherit the
toc="no" setting.</p>
