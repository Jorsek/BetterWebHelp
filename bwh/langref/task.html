<div class="section"><div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Beginning with DITA 1.2, there are two
task models available in the DTD and Schema packages distributed by
OASIS. One model, referred to as the general task, allows two additional
elements inside the task body (&lt;section&gt; and &lt;steps-informal&gt;);
it also allows multiple instances and orders for each element within &lt;taskbody&gt;.
The second model, referred to as the strict task, maintains the order
and cardinality of the DITA 1.0 and 1.1 taskbody. This strict task
is implemented in the DTD and Schema with a constraint module.</div>
