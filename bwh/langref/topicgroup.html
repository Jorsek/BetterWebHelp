<div class="section">Beginning with DITA 1.2, you are able to specify
a &lt;navtitle&gt; element within the &lt;topicmeta&gt; element inside of
a &lt;topicgroup&gt;. The &lt;topicgroup&gt; element is meant as a non-titled
grouping element, so adding a &lt;navtitle&gt; element to the &lt;topicgroup&gt;
element has no defined purpose, and processors must ignore the title.
Processors may (but need not) issue a message when ignoring the title.</div>
