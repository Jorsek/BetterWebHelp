<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">The &lt;<span class="keyword">topichead</span>&gt; element
provides a title-only entry in a navigation map, which should appear
as a heading when the map is rendered as a table of contents. In print
contexts it should also appear as a heading in the rendered content.</p>

<div class="section">Beginning with DITA 1.2, the navtitle can be specified
by using a &lt;navtitle&gt; element within the &lt;topicmeta&gt; element,
so the &lt;topichead&gt; element no longer requires the navtitle attribute.
In order to ensure backward compatibility with earlier versions of
DITA, the new &lt;navtitle&gt; element is not required. However, a &lt;topichead&gt;
element must contain either a navtitle attribute or a &lt;topicmeta&gt;
element that contains a &lt;navtitle&gt; element. DITA processors should
generate a warning if a navigation title is not specified.</div>
