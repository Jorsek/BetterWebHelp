<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">Use footnote (&lt;<span class="keyword">fn</span>&gt;) to annotate
text with notes that are inappropriate for inline inclusion or to
indicate the source for facts or other material used in the text. </p>

<div class="section">Footnote content is skipped at the place where it was entered
and rendered elsewhere, according to these rules: <ul class="ul">
<li class="li">A footnote with no given <em class="ph i"><span class="keyword">id</span></em> attribute
is a <strong class="ph b">single-use</strong> footnote. Upon output, it generates a number
as a superscript <span class="q">"callout"</span> that is linked to the placement of
the footnote, such as at the bottom of the immediate printed page
or at the end of an online article. If a character is specified in
the <em class="ph i"><span class="keyword">callout</span></em> attribute for the footnote,
that character should be used as the superscript <span class="q">"callout"</span> that
is linked to the placement of the footnote.</li>

<li class="li">A footnote entered with an <em class="ph i"><span class="keyword">id</span></em> attribute
is a <strong class="ph b">use-by-reference</strong> footnote. Upon output, it does not appear
anywhere unless it has been referenced using an &lt;<span class="keyword">xref</span>&gt;
with the <em class="ph i"><span class="keyword">type</span></em> attribute set to <span class="q">"fn"</span>. </li>

<li class="li">Ordinarily, a footnote in one topic can't be referenced in another
topic. The previous behaviors are local to each topic. But by using
the <span class="keyword">conref</span> mechanism, you can create a new copy
of another topic's footnote within the local topic where it will then
follow these behaviors:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">If you use <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;fn conref="file.dita#topic/thatid"&gt;&lt;/fn&gt;</samp> all
by itself, the result will be the same as the single-use footnote
entered literally in the same location. That is, it creates a local
copy of the footnote with no local id attribute, so it uses the behavior
from the first bullet above.</li>

<li class="li">If you use <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;fn conref="file.dita#topic/thatid" id="thisid"&gt;&lt;/fn&gt;</samp>,
followed by <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;xref href="#thistopic/thisid" type="fn"/&gt;</samp>,
the result will be the same as the use-by-reference model described
in the second bullet. That is, the &lt;fn&gt; element creates a local
copy of the footnote with an id of "thisid"; that local copy is then
referenced by the &lt;xref&gt; element.</li>

</ul>
</li>

</ul>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The details of footnote processing and styling are implementation
and/or stylesheet dependent. For example, a tool that renders DITA
as PDF may lack support for the <em class="ph i">callout</em> attribute, or footnotes
may be collected as endnotes for certain types of publications.</div>
