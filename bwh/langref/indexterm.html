<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">The content of an &lt;<span class="keyword">indexterm</span>&gt; element
is used to produce an index entry in the generated index. You can
nest indexterm elements to create multi-level indexes. The content
is not output as part of the topic content, only as part of the index.</p>

<div class="section"><p class="p">An &lt;indexterm&gt; element (with no start or end attribute
specified) is interpreted as a point reference that will contribute
the number of the current page to an index entry whose contents is
the content of the indexterm. All indexterms with the same content
are "merged" to form a single index entry in the resulting index,
and all contributed page numbers are included in that index entry.</p>
<p class="p">In
the case of nested indexterms, the indexterms with no indexterm children
(i.e., the "leaves") each contribute a page number to the generated
index; the ancestral indexterm elements for each leaf indexterm provide
the higher levels for the multilevel entry.</p>
<p class="p">An indexterm that
occurs in a topic prolog is interpreted as a point reference to the
title of the topic. Likewise, an indexterm that occurs in &lt;topicmeta&gt;
inside of a &lt;topicref&gt; is interpreted as a point reference to the
title of the referenced topic.</p>
<p class="p">It is an error if an indexterm
containing no indexterm children contains both an index-see and an
index-see-also.  (Note: index-see and index-see-also elements within
indexterms that do contain indexterm children are ignored.)  In the
case of this error condition, an implementation may (but need  not)
give an error message, and may (but need not) recover by treating
all such index-see elements as index-see-also  elements.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The
index-see and index-see-also elements are domain specializations of
the &lt;index-base&gt; element, and are discussed in detail with the
indexing domain.</div>
</div>

<div class="section"><p class="p">The start and end attribute on indexterm can
be used in cases where one wants to index an extended discussion that
may continue over a number of pages. The start of a range is indicated
by an indexterm with a start attribute. The end of a range is indicated
with an indexterm with an end attribute whose value matches that of
the start attribute on the start-of-range indexterm. Such markup contributes
to the generated index a page range covering all pages in the index
range. </p>
<p class="p">The end-of-range indexterm should have no content of
its own; if it contains content, that content is ignored. There is
no reason for the end-of-range indexterm to have any indexterm ancestors;
however, an implementation should be able to handle an end-of-range
indexterm that is nested within one or more indexterms.</p>
<p class="p">The
start and end attributes are defined as CDATA, though it is recommended
that the values should not contain any whitespace characters (e.g.,
space or tab) or control characters. Matching of start and end attributes
is done as a character-by-character comparison with all characters
significant and no case folding occurring. The start and end attributes
are ignored if they occur on an indexterm element that has child indexterm
elements.</p>
<div class="p">Index range indications may occur in the topicmeta
of a topicref at the map level, in the prolog of a topic, or in the
body of a topic, and are interpreted as follows (see <a xmlns:functx="http://www.functx.com" class="- topic/xref  ajaxLink" href="#indexterm__ranges">Figure 3</a> for samples):<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">In a map, the start range points to the start of the topic title
of the topic being referenced by its containing topicref. The end
range points to the end of the final child contained by the topic
being referenced by its containing topicref, or to the end of the
final topic referenced by the current map (whichever comes first).
When a start and end range occur in the same topicmeta, the range
applies to the containing topicref and its children.</li>

<li class="li">In the prolog of a topic, the start range points to the start
of the containing topic's title. The range ends with a matching index
range end in the same prolog, regardless of whether the end range
is specified. The range applies to the containing topic and all its
children including child relationships defined in a map.</li>

<li class="li">In the body of a topic, the range starts where the start indexterm
occurs and ends at the matching index range end indication within
the same body, or at the end of the body, whichever comes first. Such
an index range does not span sub-topics of the topic.</li>

</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">When index ranges with the same identifier overlap, the
widest range applies, and end ranges are matched with start ranges
by last-in-first-out. In other words, the ranges are interpreted as
nested rather than overlapping with the highest-level container taking
precedence over narrower contained ranges.</p>
<p class="p">As defined above,
there is no such thing as an index range start that isn't terminated
by either a matching end or some maximum scope. There can, however,
be unmatched index range end indications; these should be ignored.</p>

    &lt;indexterm&gt;pecorino&lt;/indexterm&gt;
  &lt;/indexterm&gt;
  &lt;indexterm&gt;goats milk
    &lt;indexterm&gt;chevre&lt;/indexterm&gt;
  &lt;/indexterm&gt;
&lt;/indexterm&gt;</pre>
</div>

<div class="p">The previous sample is equivalent to the following sample:<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;indexterm&gt;cheese

    &lt;indexterm&gt;pecorino&lt;/indexterm&gt;

</div>

<div class="p">In each case, a generated index would include something like the
this:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">cheese<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">goats milk<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">chevre 14</li>

<div class="fig fignone" id="indexterm__ranges"><span class="figcap">Figure 3. Index ranges</span>
<div class="p">A simple index range will look something like this:<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;indexterm start="cheese"&gt;Cheese&lt;/indexterm&gt;
&lt;!-- ... additional content --&gt;
&lt;indexterm end="cheese"/&gt;</pre>
</div>

<div class="p">The previous combination of terms will generate a top-level index
term for "Cheese" that covers a series of pages, such as:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">Cheese 18-24</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="p">Specifying a range for nested terms is similar. In this sample,
the range is specified for the tertiary index entry "pecorino":<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;indexterm&gt;cheese
  &lt;indexterm&gt;sheeps milk
    &lt;indexterm start="level-3-pecorino"&gt;pecorino&lt;/indexterm&gt;
  &lt;/indexterm&gt;
&lt;/indexterm&gt;
 &lt;!-- ... additional content ... --&gt;
&lt;indexterm end="level-3-pecorino"/&gt;</pre>
</div>

<div class="p">The generated index for that range would look something like this: <ul class="ul">
<li class="li">cheese<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">sheeps milk<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">pecorino 18-24</li>

</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="p">There are three locations that may declare a range - the body of
a topic, the prolog of a topic, and a map.</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">In the following example, the range begins at the start of the
second paragraph, and continues to the last paragraph. If the matching
end range was not included, the range would end at the end of the
body element.<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;topic id="accounting"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Accounting regulations&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be ethical in your accounting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;indexterm start="acctrules"&gt;Rules&lt;/indexterm&gt;Remember to do all of the following: ...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;!-- ...pages worth of rules... --&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;indexterm end="acctrules"/&gt;Failure to comply will get you audited.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;!-- Potential sub-topics --&gt;
&lt;/topic&gt;</pre>
</li>

<li class="li">In the following example, the range begins with the start of the
topic's title, and covers the entire topic and any sub-topics.
The range ends within the same prolog, regardless of whether <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;indexterm
end="acct"/&gt;</samp> is specified in the prolog.<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;topic id="accounting"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Accounting rugulations&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;prolog&gt;
    &lt;metadata&gt;
      &lt;keywords&gt;&lt;indexterm start="acct"&gt;Accounting&lt;/indexterm&gt;&lt;/keywords&gt;
    &lt;/metadata&gt;
  &lt;/prolog&gt;
  &lt;!-- Body and sub-topics --&gt;
&lt;/topic&gt;</pre>
</li>

<li class="li">Now assume that the topic in the previous sample is named acct.dita.
Ranges defined in a prolog cover sub-topics, including those nested
based on a map; in the following example, this means that the range
covers all of acct.dita, as well as procedures.dita and forms.dita:<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;topicref href="acct.dita"&gt;
  &lt;topicref href="procedures.dita"/&gt;
  &lt;topicref href="forms.dita"/&gt;
&lt;/topicref&gt;</pre>
</li>

<li class="li">In the final example, the range is specified in a map. The index
range for "Accounting" begins with the start of the first topic title
in acct.dita, and covers that file as well as any sub-topics. The
index range for "Government forms" begins with the start of the first
topic title in acct.dita, and continues until the end of the last
element in the file taxfiling.dita. If the end range for "govt" was
not specified, the range would continue to the end of the map.<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;topicref href="acct.dita"&gt;
  &lt;topicmeta&gt;
    &lt;keywords&gt;
      &lt;indexterm start="acct"&gt;Accounting&lt;/indexterm&gt;
      &lt;indexterm end="acct"/&gt;
      &lt;indexterm start="govt"&gt;Government forms&lt;/indexterm&gt;
    &lt;/keywords&gt;
  &lt;/topicmeta&gt;
  &lt;!-- Nested topicref elements --&gt;
&lt;/topicref&gt;
&lt;topicref href="taxfiling.dita"&gt;
  &lt;topicmeta&gt;
    &lt;keywords&gt;
      &lt;indexterm end="govt"/&gt;
